#Personal Resume Site

This is a Personal resume site that was coded while doing the [Udacity](https;//www.udacity.com) Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.
While this project is going to be updated while my Portfolio grows larger, it still is not a complete project. I have yet to add JQuery to update
links in the site. This is can be found served at: [AndreaCozart.com](http://www.andreacozart.com).

##Document
Includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and will include JQuery. This project was an original fork from @udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume

###Personal Info

My name is Andrea. I am a former Truck driver that was injured at work. Because of the injury and with having a lot of time on my hands during this time, I decided to learn more
about Web Development. I have enjoyed every bit of the learning experience from the heartache of not under standing something to the ability to breeze through some of the content I already knew a little bit of.

The first website I ever made was done with a program called Sandbox back in 2010. I had gotten that copy of Sandbox for free when I worked for Apple as a Mac Specialist in 2007.
I had used a lot of the software afforded to me via that wonderful job, but it took me years to ever try my hand in web design. My first site was for my personal business Ruco Transport, LLC. It turned out pretty well for being my first, but after that experience, I craved to learn more. I did a little bit of learning when I could that included the Adobe suite, basic HTML and some CSS. After getting my first Arduino development board, I realized that there was still so much to learn! While I believe that we never stop learning, I have made it my passion to learn all that I can about computer programming. While I have made a few choices in the direction of the programming, I don't wish to stop at those languages.
